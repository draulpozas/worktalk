GETTING STARTED:

The database script is located in db/sql/init.sql

Two users will be created with the following credentials:
username: john smith
password: iamjohnsmith
--
username: lina watson
password: iamlinawatson

The application may be tested using those credentials or creating a new user (a valid email address is required).

After the database generation go to the /config directory. Then:

- In autoload.php, change the value of 'APP_URL' to the path where the 'app' folder is located in your machine. If it is in a localhost, the word 'localhost' itself must not be included.
The application expects the path of /app FROM the localhost, so if the app files are located in, for instance, "localhost/dw2e/student03" then the constant should be defined as '/dw2e/student03/app' (with a slash at the beginning and NO SLASH at the end).

- In connection.json, define the user and password for your mysql server, in "DB_USER" and "DB_PASS" respectively.

After doing this, everything should work as intended!
